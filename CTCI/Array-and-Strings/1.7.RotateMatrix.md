Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?

## My Answer:
```java

char[][] rotate(char[][] image) {

	int row = image.size();
	int col = image[0].size();
	char[][] answer = new char[][image[0].size()]();

	for(int c = 0; c < col; c++ ) {
		for(int r = 0; r < row; r++) {
	    answer[c][r] = image[r][c];
    }
  }
  return answer;
}



```
