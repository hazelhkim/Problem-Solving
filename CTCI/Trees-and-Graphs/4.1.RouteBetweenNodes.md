Given a directed graph, design an algorithm to find out whether there is a route between two nodes. 

#### Textbook Solution:

This problem can be solved by just simple graph traversal, such as depth-first search or breadth-frist search. 
We start with one of the two nodes and, during traversal, check if the other node is found. 
We should mark any node found in the course of the algorithm as "already visited" to avoid cycles and repetition of the nodes. 

The code below provides an iterative implementation of breadth-first search.
```java
enum State {Unvisited, Visited, Visiting; } 

boolean search (Graph g, Node start, Node end) {
  if (start == end) return true;
  
  //operates as Queue
  LinkedList<Node> q = new LinkedList<Node>();
  
  for(Node u : g.getNodes()) {
    u.state = State.Unvisited;
  }
  start.state = State.Visiting;
  q.add(start);
  Node u;
  while(!q.isEmpty()) {
    u = q.removeFirst(); // i.e., dequeue()
    if(u != null) {
      for(Node v: u.getAdjacent()) {
          if(v.state == State.Unvisited) {
              if(v == end) {
                 return true;
              } else {
                  v.state = State.Visiting;
                  q.add(v);
              }
          }
      }
      u.state = State.Visited;
     }
   }
   return false;
}

```
