## 4.8. First Common Ancestor

Design an algorithm and write code to find the first common ancestor of two nodes in a binary tree. Avoid storing additional nodes in a data structure. <br />
NOTE: This is not necessarily a binary search tree. 

### Solution

- If this were a binary search tree, we could modify the *find* operation for the two nodes and see where the paths diverge. Unfortunately, this is not a binary search tree, so we must try other approaches.

- Let's assume we're looking for the common ancestor of nodes p and q. One question to ask here is if each node in our tree has a link to its parents.

#### Solution #1. With Links to Parents
(If each node has a link to its parent, we could trace p and q's paths up until they intersect. This is essentially the same problem as question 2.7 which find the intersection of two linked lists.The "linked list"in this case is the path from each node up to the root.)

```java
TreeNode commonAncestor(TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
  int delta = depth(p) - depth(q);  // get difference in depths
  TreeNode first = delta > 0 ? q : p;  // get deeper node
  TreeNode second = delta > 0 ? p : q; // get deeper node
  second = goUpBy(second, Math.abs(delta));  // move deeper node up

  /* Find where paths intersect. */
  while(first != second && first != null && second != null){
    first = first.parent;
    second = second.parent;
  }
  return first == null || second == null ? null : first;
}

TreeNode goUpBy(TreeNode node, int delta) {
  while (delta > 0 && node != null) {
    node = node.parent;
    delta--;
  }
  return node;
}

int depth(TreeNode node){
  int depth = 0;
  while (node != null) {
    node = node.parent;
    depth++;
  }
  return depth;
}

```
This approach will take O(d) time, where d is the depth of the deeper node. 


#### Solution #2: With Links to Parents (Better Worst-Case Runtime)

- Similar to the earlier approach, we could trace p's path upwards and check if any of the nodes cover q. The first node that covers q (we already know that every node on this path will cover p) must be the first common ancestor.
- Observe that we don't need to re-check the entire subtree. As we move from a node xto its parent y, all the nodes under x have already been checked for q. Therefore, we only need to check the new nodes "uncov- ered ': which will be the nodes under x's sibling.
- For example, suppose we're looking for the first common ancestor of node p = 7 and node q = 17. When we go to p. parent (5), we uncover the subtree rooted at 3. We therefore need to search this subtree for q.
- Next, we go to node 10, uncovering the subtree rooted at 15. We check this subtree for node 17 a n d - voila- there it is.

To implement this, we can just traverse upwards from p, storing the pa rent and the sibling node in a variable. (The sibling node is always a child of parent and refers to the newly uncovered subtree.) At each iteration, sibling gets set to the old parent's sibling node and parent gets set to parent. parent:

```java
TreeNode commonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
  /* Check if either node is not in the tree, or if one covers the other. */
  if( !covers(root, p) || !covers(root, q) ) {
    return null;
  } else if ( covers(p, q) ) {
    return p;
  } else if ( covers(q, p) ) {
    return q;
  }

  /* Traverse upwards until you find a node that covers q. */
  TreeNode sibling = getSibling(p);
  TreeNode parent = p.parent;
  while( !covers(sibling, q) ){
    sibling = getSibling(parent);
    parent = parent.parent;
  }
  return parent;
}

boolean covers(TreeNode root, TreeNode p) {
  if(root == null) return false;
  if(root == p) return true;
  return covers(root.left, p) || covers(root.right, p);
}

TreeNode getSibling(TreeNode node) {
  if(node == null || node.parent == null) {
    return null;
  }
  
  TreeNode parent = node.parent;
  return parent.left == node ? parent.right : parent.left;
}

```


This algorithm takes 0 ( t ) time, where t is the size of the subtree for the first common ancestor. In the worst case, this will be 0 (n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. We can derive this runtime by noticing that each node in that subtree is searched once.

#### Solution #3: Without Links to Parents


Alternatively, you could follow a chain in which p and q are on the same side.That is, if p and q are both on the left of the node, branch left to look for the common ancestor. If they are both on the right, branch right to look for the common ancestor. When p and q are no longer on the same side, you must have found the first common ancestor.
<br />

The code below implements this approach: 

```java
TreeNode commonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
  /* Error check - one node is not in the tree. */
  if( !covers(root, p) || !covers(root, q) ) {
    return null;
  }
  return ancestorHelper(root, p, q);
}

TreeNode ancestorHelper(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
  if(root == null || root == p || root == q) {
    return root;
  }
  
  boolean pIsOnLeft = covers(root.left, p);
  boolean qIsOnLeft = covers(root.left, q);
  if( pIsOnLeft != qIsOnLeft ) { // Nodes are on different side
    return root;
  }
  TreeNode childSide = pIsOnLeft ? root.left : root.right;
  return ancestorHelper(childSide, p, q);
}

boolean covers(TreeNode root, TreeNode p) {
  if(root == null) return false;
  if(root == p) return true;
  return covers(root.left, p) || covers(root.right, p);
}

```
- This algorithm runs in O( n) time on a balanced tree. This is because covers is called on 2n nodes in the first call (n nodes for the left side, and n nodes for the right side). After that, the algorithm branches left or right, at which point covers will be called on 2n/2 nodes, then 2n/4, and so on. This results in a runtime of O(n).
- We know at this point that we cannot do better than that in terms of the asymptotic runtime since we need to potentially look at every node in the tree. However, we may be able to improve it by a constant multiple.

#### Solution #4: Optimized

- Although Solution #3 is optimal in its runtime, we may recognize that there is still some inefficiency in how it operates. Specifically, covers searches all nodes under root for p and q, including the nodes in each subtree(*root.left* and *root.right*).Then,it picks one of those subtrees and searches all of its nodes. Each subtree is searched over and over again.
- We may recognize that we should only need to search the entire tree once to find p and q.We should then be able to "bubble up"the findings to earlier nodes in the stack.The basic logic is the same as the earlier solution.
- We recurse through the entire tree with a function called *commonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q)*. This function returns values as follows.
  - Returns p, if root's subtree includes p (and not q).
  - Returns q, if root's subtree includes q (and not p).
  - Returns null, if neither p nor q are in root's subtree.
  - Else, returns the common ancestor of p and q.
  
- Finding the common ancestor of p and q in the final case is easy.When commonAncestor (n . left , p, q) and commonAncestor (n. right, p, q) both return non-null values (indicating that p and q were found in different subtrees), then n will be the common ancestor.


The code below offers an initial solution, but it has a bug. Can you find it?
```java
/* The below code has a bug. */
TreeNode commonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
  if(root == null) return null;
  if(root == p && root == q) return root;
 
  TreeNode x = commonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
  if( x != null && x != p && x != q ) {  // Already found ancestor
    return x;
  }
  
  TreeNode y = commonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
  if( y != null && y != p && y != q ) {  // Already found ancestor
    return y;
  }
  
  if( x != null && y != null ) {  // p and q found in diff. subtrees
    return root;  // This is the common ancestor
  } else if ( root == p || root == q ) {
    return root;
  } else {
    return x == null ? y : x;   /* return the non-null value */
  }
}

```

The problem with this code occurs in the case where a node is not contained in the tree. For example, look at the following tree:

<img width="366" alt="Screen Shot 2019-09-14 at 1 53 03 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46575719/64912572-40d47b80-d6e6-11e9-987e-2fa4f750171a.png">

SupposewecalicommonAncestor(node 3, node 5, node 7).Ofcourse,node 7doesnotexist- and that's where the issue will come in.The calling order looks like:

```java
commonAnc(node 3, node 5, node 7)               // --> 5
  calls commonAnc(node 1, node 5, node 7)       // --> null
    calls commonAnc(node 5, node 5, node 7)     // --> 5
      calls commonAnc(node 8, node 5, node 7)   // --> null

```
In other words, when we call commonAncestor on the right subtree, the code will return node 5, just as it should.The problem is that, in finding the common ancestor of p and q, the calling function can't distin- guish between the two cases:

  - Case 1: p is a child of q (or, q is a child of p)
  - Case 2: p is in the tree and q is not (or, q is in the tree and p is not)

In either of these cases, commonAncestor will return p. ln the first case, this is the correct return value, but
in the second case, the return value should be null.
<br />

We somehow need to distinguish between these two cases, and this is what the code below does. This code solves the problem by returning two values: the node itself and a flag indicating whether this node is actually the common ancestor.

```java

class Result {
  public TreeNode node;
  public boolean isAncestor;
  publc Result(TreeNode n, boolean isAnc){
    node = n;
    isAncestor = isAnc;
  }
}

TreeNode commonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
  Result r = commonAncestorHelper(root, p, q);
  if(r.isAncestor) {
    return r.node;
  }
  return null;
}

Result commonAncHelper(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
  if( root == null) return new Result(null, false);
  
  if( root == p && root == q) {
    return new Result(root, true);
  }
  
  Result rx = commonAncHelper(root.left, p, q);
  if( rx.isAncestor ) {  // Found common ancestor
    return rx;
  }
  
  Result ry = commonAncHelper(root.right, p, q);
  if( ry.isAncestor ) {  // Found common ancestor
    return ry;
  }
  
  if(rx.node != null && ry.node != null) {
    return new Result(root, true);  // This is the common ancestor
  } else if( root == p || root == q ) {
      /* If we're currently at p or q, and we also found one of those nodes in a 
       * subtree, then this is truly an ancestor and the flag should be true. */
      boolean isAncestor = rx.node != null || ry.node != null;
      return new Result(root, isAncestor);
  } else {
      return new Result(rx.node != null ? rx.node : ry.node, false);
  }
}

```
Of course, as this issue only comes up when p or q is not actually in the tree, an alternative solution would be to first search through the entire tree to make sure that both nodes exist.
