## 4.5. Validate BST

Implement a function to check if a binary tree is a binary search tree.

#### Solution

We can implement this solution in two different ways. The first leverages the in-order traversal, 
and the second builds off the property that **left <= current < right**.

#### Solution #1. In-Order Traversal

Our first thought might be to do an in-order traversal, copy the elements to an array, and then check to see
if the array is sorted. This solution takes up a bit of extra memory, but it works -- mostly. <br />

The only problem is that it can't handle duplicate values in the tree properly. For example, the algorithm
cannot distinguish between the two trees below (one of which is invalid) since they have the same in-order traversal.

However, if we assume that the tree cannot have duplicate values, then this approach works. The pseudocode for this method looks something like:

```java
int index = 0;
void copyBST(TreeNode root, int[] array) {
  if(root == null) return;
  copyBST(root.left, array);
  array[index] = root.data;
  index++;
  copyBST(root.right, array);
}

boolean checkBST(TreeNode root) {
  int[] array = new int[root.size];
  copyBST(root, array);
  for (int i = 1; i< array.length; i++) {
    if(array[i] <= array[i-1] return false;
  }
  return true;
}

```

Note that it is necessary to keep track of the logical "end" of the array, since it would be allocated to 
hold all the elements. <br />

When we examine this solution, we find that the array is not actually necessary. We never use it other than to compare an element to the previous element. So why not just track the last element we saw and compare it as we go? <br />

The code below implements this algorithm:
```java
Integer last_printed = null;
boolean checkBST(TreeNode n) {
  if(n == null) return true;
  
  // Check / recurse left
  if ( !checkBST(n.left)) return false;
  
  // Check current 
  if (last_printed != null && n.data <= last_printed) {
    return false;
  }
  last_printed = n.data;
  
  // Check / recurse right
  if( !checkBST(n.right)) return false;
  
  return true; //All good!
}

```
We've used an *Integer* instead of *int* so that we can know when *last_printed* has been set to a value. <br />
If you don't like the use of static variables, then you can tweak this code to use a wrapper class for the integer, as shown below: 
```java
class WrapInt {
  print int value;
}
```
Or, if you're implementing this in C++ or another language that supports passing integers by reference, then you can simply do that. 



#### Solution #2. The Min / Max Solution

In the second solution, we leverage the definition of the binary search tree. <br />

What does it mean for a tree to be a binary search tree? We know that it must, of course, satisfy the condition **left.data <= current.data < right.data** for each node, but this isn't quite sufficient. Consider the following small tree:

Although each node is bigger than its left node and smaller than its right node, this is clearly not a binary search tree since 25 is in the wrong place. <br />

More precisely, the condition is that *all* left nodes must be less than or equal to the current node, which must be less than all the right nodes. < br />

Using this thought, we can approach the problem by passing down the min and max values. As we iterate through the tree, we verify against progressively narrower ranges. < br />

Consider the following sample tree:

<img width="398" alt="Screen Shot 2019-09-14 at 10 33 30 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46575719/64910364-605dab00-d6ca-11e9-8545-ae3bf424c6f8.png">

We start with a range of (min = NULL, max = NULL), which the root obviously meets. (NULL indicates that there is no min or max.) We then branch left, checking that these nodes are within the range (min = NULL, max = 20). Then, we branch right, checking that the nodes are within the range (min = 20, max = NULL). <br />

We proceed through the tree with this approach. When we branch left, the max gets updated. When we branch right, the min gets updated. If anything fails these checks, we stop and return false.  <br />

The time complexity for this solution is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. We can prove that this is the best we can do, since any algorithm must touch all N nodes. <br />

Due to the use of recursion, the space complexity is O(log N) on a balanced tree. There are up to O(log N) recursive calls on the stack since we may recurse up to the depth of the tree. <br />

The recursive code for this is as follows:
```java
boolean checkBST(TreeNode n) {
  return checkBST(n, null, null);  
}
boolean checkBST(TreeNode n, Integer min, Integer max) {
  if(n == null) {
    return true;
  }
  if((min != null && n.data <= min) || (max!= null && n.data > max)) {
    return false;
  }
  if(!checkBST(n.left, min, n.data) || !checkBST(n.right, n.data, max)) {
    return false;
  }
  return true;
}

```
Remember that in recursive algorithms, you should always make sure that your base cases, as well as your null cases, are well handled.
