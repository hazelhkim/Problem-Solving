## Validate BST

Implement a function to check if a binary tree is a binary search tree.

#### Solution

We can implement this solution in two different ways. The first leverages the in-order traversal, 
and the second builds off the property that **left <= current < right**.

#### Solution #1. In-Order Traversal

Our first thought might be to do an in-order traversal, copy the elements to an array, and then check to see
if the array is sorted. This solution takes up a bit of extra memory, but it works -- mostly. <br />

The only problem is that it can't handle duplicate values in the tree properly. For example, the algorithm
cannot distinguish between the two trees below (one of which is invalid) since they have the same in-order traversal.
