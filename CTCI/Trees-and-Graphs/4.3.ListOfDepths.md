### 4.3. List of Depths

Given a binary tree, design an algorithm which creates a linked list of all the nodes at each depth (e.g., if you have a tree with depth D, you’ll have D linked lists).


#### Solution 1. 

- This problem seems like it requires a level-by-level traversal, it isn’t actually necessary. We can traverse the graph any way that we’d like, provided we know which level we’re on as we do so.
- We can implement a simple modification of the pre-order traversal algorithm, where we pass in level + 1 to the next recursive call. 
<br />

The code below provides an implementation using **depth-first search**: 

```java

Void createLevelLinkedList(TreeNode root, ArrayList<LinkedList<TreeNode>> lists, int level) {

	if(root == null) return;	   // base case

	LinkedList<TreeNode> list = null;
	
	if( lists.size() == level ) {
		list = new LinkedList<TreeNode>();
		/* Levels are always traversed in order. So, if this is the first time we’ve
		 * visited level i, we must have seen levels 0 through i-1. We can
		 * therefore safely add the level at the end.  */
		lists.add(list);
	} else {
		list = lists.get(level);
	}
	list.add(root);
	createLevelLinkedList(root.left, lists, level+1);
	createLevelLinkedList(root.right, lists, level+1);
}

ArrayList<LinkedList<TreeNode>> createLevelLinkedList( TreeNode root ) {
	ArrayList<LinkedList<TreeNode>> lists = new ArrayList<LinkedList<TreeNode>>();
	createLevelLinkedList(root, lists, 0);
	return lists;	
}


```
#### Solution 2.

- Alternatively, we can also implement a modification of **breadth-first search**. With this implementation, we want to iterate through the root first, then level 2, then level 3, and so on. 

- With each level i, we will have already full visited all nodes on level i -1. This means that to get which nodes are on level i, we can simply look at all children of the nodes level i -1.

The code below implements this algorithm.

```java

ArrayList<LinkedList<TreeNode>> createLevelLinkedList(TreeNode root) {

	ArrayList<LinkedList<TreeNode>> result = new ArrayList<LinkedList<TreeNode>>();
	/* “Visited” the root */
	LinkedList<TreeNode> current = new LinkedList<TreeNode>();
	if(root != null) {
		current.add(root);
	}

	while(current.size() > 0) {
		result.add(current); // Add previous level
		LinkedList<TreeNode> parents = current; // Go to next level
		current = new LinkedList<TreeNode>();
		for(TreeNode parent : parents) {
			/* Visited the children */
			if (parent.left != null) {
				current.add(parent.left);
			}
			if (parent.right != null) {
				current.add(parent.right);
			}
		}
	}
	return result;
}

```

- One must ask which of these solution is more efficient
- Both run in O(N) time
- But what about the space efficiency? — In a sense,  the second solution is more space efficient.
	- The first solution uses O(log N) recursive calls (in a balanced tree), each of which adds a new level to the stack.
	- The second solution, which is iterative, does not require this extra space. 
- However, both solutions require returning O(N) data. The extra O(log N) space usage from the recursive implementation is dwarfed by the O(N) data that must be returned. 
- So while the first solution may actually use more data, they are equally efficient when it comes to “big O.”
