## 3.1. Three in One

Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks. 

### Solution

#### Approach 1: Fixed Division
We can divide the array in three equal parts and allow the individual stack to grow in that limited space. 
Note: We will use the notation "[" to mean inclusive of an end point and "(" to mean exclusive of an end point.

- For stack 1, we will use [0, n/3).
- For stack 2, we will use [n/3, 2n/3).
- For stack 3, we will use [2n/3, n).

The code for this solution:
```java
class FixedMultiStack {
  private int numberOfStack = 3;
  private int stackCapacity;
  private int[] values;
  private int[] sizes;
  
  public FixedMultiStack(int stackSize) {
    stackCapacity = stackSize;
    values = new int[stackSize * numberOStacks];
    sizes = new int[numberOfStacks];
  }
  
  /* Push value onto stack. */
  public void push(int stackNum, int value) throws FullStackException {
    /* Check that we have space for the next element */
    if (isFull(stackNum)) {
      throw new FullStackException();
    }
    
    /* Increment stack pointer and then update top value. */
    sizes[stackNum]++;
    values[indexOfTop(stackNum)] = value;
  }
  
  /* Pop item from top stack */
  public int pop(int stackNum) {
    if(isEmpty(stackNum)){
      throw new EmptyStackException();
    }
    
    int topIndex = indexOfTop(stackNum);
    int value = values[topIndex];  //Get top
    values[topIndex] = 0  // Clear
    sizes[stackNum]--; // Shrink
    return values;
  }
  
  /* Return top element. */
  public int peek(int stackNum) {
    if (isEmpty(stacknum) {
      throw new EmptyStackException();
    }
    return values[indexOfTop(stackNum)];
  }
  
  /* Return if stack is empty. */
  public boolean isEmpty(int stackNum) {
    return sizes[stackNum] == 0;
  }
  
  /* Return if stack is full. */
  public boolean isFull(int stackNum) {
    return sizes[stackNum] == stackCapacity;
  }
  
  /* Returns index of the top of the stack. */
  private int indexOfTop(int stackNum){
    int offset = stackNum * stackCapacity;
    int size = sizes[stackNum];
    return offset + size - 1;
  }
}

```

If we had additional information about the expected usages of the stacks, then we could modify this algorithm accordingly.
For example, if we expected Stack 1 to have many more elements than Stack2, we could allocate more space to Stak1 and less space to Stack2. 

#### Approach 2: Flexible Divisions

- A second approach is to allow the stack blocks to be flexible in size. When one stack exceeds its initial capacity, we grow the allowable capacity and shift elements as necessary.
- We will also design our array to be circular, such taht the final stack may start at the end of the array and wrap around to the beginning.
- Please note that the code for this solution is far more complex than would be appropriate for an interview. You could be responsible for pseudocode, or
perhaps the code of individual components, but the entire implementation would be far too much work.

```java
public class MultiStack {
  /* StackInfo is a simple class that holds a set of data about each stack. It
   * does not hold the actual items in the stack. We could have done this with 
   * just a bunch of individual variables, but that's messy and doesn't gain us much */
   private class StackInfo {
      public int start, size, capacity;
      public StackInfo (int start, int capacity) {
          this.start = start;
          this.capacity = capacity;
    }
    /* Check if an index on the full array is within the stack boundaries. The 
     * stack can wrap around to the start of the array. */
    public boolean isWithinStackCapacity(int index) {
        /* If outside of bounds of array, return false. */
        if(index < 0 || index >= values.length) {
            return false;
        }
        
        /* If index wraps around, adjust it. */
        int contiguousIndex = index < start ? index + values.length : index;
        int end = start + capacity;
        return start <= contiguousIndex && contiguousIndex < end;
        
     }
     
     public int lastCapacityIndex() {
        return adjustIndex(start + capacity -1);
     }
     
     public int lastElementIndex() {
        return adjustIndex( start + size - 1);
     }
     
     public boolean isFull() {  return size == capacity; }
     public boolean isEmpty() {  return size == 0; }
  }
  
  private StackInto[] info;
  private int[] values;
  
  public MultiStack(int numberOfStacks, int defaultSize) {
    /* Create metadata for all the stacks. */
    info = new StackInfo[numberOfStacks];
    for (int i = 0; i < numberOfStacks; i++) {
      info[i] = new StackInfo(defaultSize * i, defaultSize);
    }
    values = new int[numberOfStacks * defaultSize];
}

```
/* Push value onto stack num, shifting/expanding stacks as necessary. Throws 
 * exception if all stacks are full. */
public void push(int stackNum, int value) throws FullStackException {
    if( allStacksAreFull()) {
        throw new FullStackException();
    }
    
    /* If this stack is full, expand it. */
    StackInfo stack = info[stackNum];
    if( stack.isFull() ) {
      expand(stackNum);
    }
    
    /* Find the index of the top element in the *array + 1*, and increment the stack pointer. */
    stack.size++;
    values[stack.lastElementIndex()] = value;
}

/* Remove value from stack. */ 
public int pop (int stackNum) throws Exception {

}
