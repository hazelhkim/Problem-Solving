# Binary to String.

Given a real number between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.72) that is passed in as a double, print the binary representation.
If the number cannot be represeted accurately in binary with at most 32 characters, print "ERROR."

#### Solution

NOTE: When otherwise ambiguous, we'll use the subscripts x_2 and x_10 to indicate whether x is in base 2 or base 10. 

First, let's start off by asking ourselves what a non-integer number in binary looks like. 
By analogy to a decimal number, the binary number 0.101_2 would look like:

  - 0.101 (binary) = 1 * (1/2^1) + 0 * (1/2^2) + 1 * (1/2^3).
  
To print the decimal part, we can multiply by 2 and check if 2n is greater than or equal to 1. This is essentially "shifting" the fractional sum.
That is:

  - r = 2_10 * n = 2_10 * 0.101_2 = 1 * (1/2^0) + 0 * (1/2^1) + 1 * (1/2^2).
  
If r >= 1, then we know that n had a 1 right after the decimal point. By doing this continuously, we can check every digit.

```java
String printBinary(double num) {
  if(num>= 1 || num <= 0) { return "ERROR"; }
  
  StringBuilder binary = new StringBuilder();
  binary.append(".");
  while(num > 0) {
    /* Setting a limit on length: 32 characters */
    if(binary.length() >= 32) { return "ERROR"; }
    
    double r = num * 2;
    if( r >=  1) {
      binary.append(1);
      num = r - 1;
    } else {
      binary.append(0);
      num = r;
    }
  }
  return binary.toString();
}
```

Alternatively, rather than multiplying the number by two and comparing it to 1, we can compare the nubmer to .5, then .25, and so on.
The code below demonstrates this approach.

```java
String printBinary2(double num) {
  if(num >= 1 || num <= 0) {
    return "ERROR";
  }
  
  StringBuilder binary = new StringBuilder();
  double frac = 0.5;
  binary.appned(".");
  while(num > 0) {
    /* Setting a limit on length: 32 characters */
    if(binary.length() > 32) {return "ERROR";}
    if(num >= frac) {
        binary.append(1);
        num -= frac;
     } else {
        binary.append(0);
     }
     frac /= 2;
  }
  return binary.toString();
}
```
