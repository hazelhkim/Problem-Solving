# Insertion.

You are given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j. Write a method to insert M into N such that M starts at bit j and 
ends at bit i. You can assume that the bits j through i have enough space to fit all of M. That is, if M = 10011, you can
assume that there are at least 5 bits between j and i. You would not, for example, have j = 3 and i = 2, because 
M could not fully fit between bit 3 and bit 2. 

- EXAMPLE
Input: N = 10000000000, M = 10011, i = 2, j = 6
Output: N = 10001001100


#### Solution

This problem can be approached in three key steps:

1. Clear the bits j through i in N.
2. Shift M so that it lines up with bits j through i.
3. Merge M and N.

The trickiest part is Step 1. How do we clear the bits in N?
- We can do this with a mask.
- This mask will have all 1s, except for 0s in the bits j through i.
- We create this mask by creating the left half of the mask first, and then the right half. 

```java 
int updateBits(int n, int m, int i, int j) {
  /* Create a mask to clear bits i through j in n. 
   * Example: i = 2, j = 4. Result should be 11100011.
   * For simplicity, we'll use just 8 bits for the example.
   */ 
   
   int allOnes = ~0;  // will equal sequence of all 1s.
   
   // 1s before position j, then 0s. left = 11100000
   int left = allOnes << (j+1);
   
   // 1's after position i. right = 00000011
   int right = (1<<i) -1);
   
   // All 1s, except for 0s between i and j. mask = 11100011
   int mask = left | right;
   
   // Clear bits j through i then put m in tere
   int n_cleared = n & mask; // Clear bits j through i.
   int m_shifted = m << i;  // Move m into correct position.
   
   return n_cleared | m_shifted;  // OR them, and we're done!
   
}
```

In a problem like this (and many bit manipulation problems), you should make sure to thoroughly test your code.
It's extremely easy to wind up with off-by-one errors.
